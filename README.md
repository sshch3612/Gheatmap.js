## How to get started

The fastest way to get started is to install Gheatmap.js with bower. Just run the following command:

`bower install Gheatmap.js-amd`

This will download the latest working version of Gheatmap.js and put it in your bower_components folder.

Alternatively you could just download [the latest release](https://github.com/pa7/Gheatmap.js/releases) from github and unzip it.

The file you're ultimately looking for is **Gheatmap.js** or **Gheatmap.min.js**

Gheatmap.js is also hosted on npm:

`npm install Gheatmap.js`

### How to run the local examples

Start a webserver (e.g. python SimpleHTTPServer from the project directory root):

`python -m SimpleHTTPServer 1337 &`

Then browse to

`http://localhost:1337/examples/`
